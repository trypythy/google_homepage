this is the first html/css project - from https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav

the aim of the project is to reconstruct the simplest of webpage - google.com(i'm guessing)

having done this seemingly simple task, one should have basic ideas about
 * how to use the *inspect element* from the browser
 * how to place the different elemenst of a webpage using HTML & CSS
